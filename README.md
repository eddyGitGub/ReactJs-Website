This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ReactJs-Website
This is a website built with React.js.

## Overview
This project was created to demonstrate building a multi-page website with React using React Router.

The website contains the following pages:

Home - A landing page

About - A simple about us page

Contact - A contact form

Shared Components - Other component use in conjunction with the above pages

Rudux - For state management

React Router is used for routing between pages.

## Stack
This project uses:

React - Frontend framework

React Router - Routing

Bootstrap - Styling

Features
Some key features:

- Multi-page React site with routing
- Responsive mobile-friendly design with Bootstrap
- React hooks for state management
- Contact form handling with Formik & Yup
Blog post listings and individual post pages
Basic components for header, footer, navigation etc.
Customization
The project can be easily extended and customized by adding new pages, styling changes, and adding additional features.

Notes
This is a simple starter React website template to demonstrate a multi-page React site with routing. For a more robust real-world example, additional features like state management with Redux, data fetching from a CMS, authentication, etc could be added.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
